# This section defines how each detected problem is treated.  Each problem
# must have an "actions" key set to zero or more of the following flags:
#     report    - the problem gets listed in the report
#     error     - the message gets counted as an error
#     dontcount - the message does not get counted as a valid checkin
#     dropmsg   - drop the entire message from the report
# In addition, if a response message should be generated for the problem, the
# problem will have a "response" or "responses" key, giving the text to be put
# into the response message.  Some problems have several alternative response
# texts; these are gathered under the "responses" key, indexed by a name that
# distinguishes them.  Most problems have only one response text, which is put
# under a "response" key.  The response texts may have interpolated {VARIABLES}
# in braces.

  CallSignConflict:
    actions: report error
    response: |
      This message has conflicting call signs.  The Subject line says the call
      sign is {FROMCALLSIGN}, but the Operator Call Sign field of the form says
      {OPCALL}.  The two should agree.  (This message will be counted as a
      practice attempt by {FROMCALLSIGN}.)
  DeliveryReceipt:

  FormCorrupt:
    actions: report error
    response: |
      This message appears to contain an encoded form, but the encoding is
      incorrect.  It appears to have been created or edited by software other
      than the current PackItForms software.  Please use current PackItForms
      software to encode messages containing forms.
  FormDestination:
    actions: report error
    responses:
      both: |
        This message form is addressed to ICS Position "{ACTUALPOSN}" at
        Location "{ACTUALLOC}".  {MSGTYPE}s should be addressed to {EXPECTPOSNS}
        at {EXPECTLOCS}.
      loc: |
        This message form is addressed to Location "{ACTUALLOC}".  {MSGTYPE}s
        should be addressed to Location {EXPECTLOCS}.
      pos: |
        This message form is addressed to ICS Position "{ACTUALPOSN}".
        {MSGTYPE}s should be addressed to ICS Position {EXPECTPOSNS}.
  FormHandlingOrder:
    actions: report error
    response: |
      This message has handling order {ACTUALHO}.  According to the SCCo
      ARES/RACES Recommended Form Routing document, it should have handling
      order {EXPECTHO}.
  FormInvalid:
    actions: report error
    response: |
      This message contains a form with invalid contents:
      {PROBLEMS}
      Please verify the correctness of the form before sending.
  FormSubject:
    actions: report error
    response: |
      This message has
          Subject: {ACTUALSUBJ}
      but, based on the contents of the form, it should have
          Subject: {EXPECTSUBJ}
      PackItForms automatically generates the Subject line from the form
      contents; it should not be overridden manually.
  FormVersion:
    actions: report error
    response: |
      This message contains version {ACTUALVER} of the {MSGTYPE}, but that
      version is not current.  Please use version {EXPECTVER} or newer of the
      form.  (You can get the newer form by updating your PackItForms
      installation.)
  FromBBSDown:
    actions: report error
    response: |
      This message was sent from {FROMBBS}, which has a simulated outage for
      {SESSIONNAME} on {SESSIONDATE}.  Practice messages should not be sent from
      BBSes that have a simulated outage.
  HandlingOrderCode:
    actions: report error
    response: |
      The Subject line of this message contains an invalid Handling Order code
      ({HANDLING}). The valid codes are "I" for Immediate, "P" for Priority, and
      "R" for Routine.
  MessageCorrupt:
    actions: report dontcount
  MessageNotASCII:
    actions: report error
    response: |
      This message contains characters that are not in the standard ASCII
      character set (i.e., not on a standard keyboard).  Non-standard characters
      should be avoided in packet messages, because the receiving system may not
      know how to render them.  Note that some software may introduce undesired
      non-standard characters (e.g., Microsoft Word's "smart quotes" feature).
      If you use message text composed in such software, make sure those
      features are disabled.
  MessageNotPlainText:
    actions: report error
    responses:
      normal: |
        This message is not a plain text message.  All SCCo packet messages
        should be plain text only.  ("Rich text" or HTML-formatted messages,
        common in email systems, are far larger than plain text messages and put
        too much strain on the packet infrastructure.)  Please configure your
        software to send plain text messages when sending to an SCCo BBS.
      winlink: |
        This message is not a plain text message.  All SCCo packet messages
        should be plain text only.  Note: messages from winlink.org are not
        plain text messages; they use an encoding system ("quoted-printable")
        that Outpost cannot decode.
  MessageTooEarly:
    actions: report dontcount
    response: |
      This message arrived at {TOBBS} on {MSGDATE}.  However, practice messages
      for {SESSIONNAME} aren't accepted until {SESSIONSTART}.
  MessageTooLate:
    actions: report dontcount
    response: |
      This message arrived at {TOBBS} on {MSGDATE}.  That was too late to be
      counted for the {SESSIONNAME} on {SUBJECTDATE}.
  MessageTypeWrong:
    actions: report error
    response: |
      This message is {AMSGTYPE}.  For the {SESSIONNAME} on {SESSIONDATE},
      {AEXPECTTYPE} is expected.
  MsgNumFormat:
    actions: report error
    response: |
      The message number of this message is not formatted correctly.  It should
      have a format like "XND-042P", containing:
        - a three-character prefix (usually the sender's call sign suffix),
        - a dash,
        - a number with at least three digits, and
        - a "P", "M", or "R" suffix.
      All letters should be upper case.  In Outpost, the format of the message
      number is set in the Message Settings dialog, which should be configured
      according to county standards.
  MsgNumPrefix:
    actions: report
    response: |
      The message number of this message has the prefix "{ACTUALPFX}".  The
      prefix should be the last three characters of your call sign,
      "{EXPECTPFX}".
  MultipleMessagesFromAddress:

  NoCallSign:
    actions: report dontcount
    responses:
      form: |
        This message cannot be counted because it's not clear who sent it.
        There is no call sign in the return address, or after the word
        "Practice" on the subject line, or in the Operator Call field of the
        form.  In order for a message to count, there must be a call sign in at
        least one of those places.
      plain: |
        This message cannot be counted because it's not clear who sent it.
        There is no call sign in the return address or after the word "Practice"
        on the subject line.  In order for a message to count, there must be a
        call sign in at least one of those places.
  PIFOVersion:
    actions: report error
    response: |
      This message used version {ACTUALVER} of PackItForms to encode the form,
      but that version is not current.  Please use PackItForms version
      {EXPECTVER} or newer to encode messages containing forms.
  PracticeSubjectFormat:
    actions: report
    responses:
      form: |
        The {SUBJECTFIELD} field of this form does not have the correct format.
        It should have the word "Practice" followed by four comma-separated
        fields:
            Practice CallSign, FirstName, Jurisdiction, NetDate
        NetDate should be in the form MM/DD/YYYY.
      plain: |
        The Subject of this message does not have the correct format.  After the
        message number and handling order, it should have the word
        "Practice" followed by four comma-separated fields:
            Practice CallSign, FirstName, Jurisdiction, NetDate
        NetDate should be in the form MM/DD/YYYY.
  ReadReceipt:
    actions: report dontcount
    response: |
      This message is an Outpost "read receipt", which should not have been
      sent.  Most likely, your Outpost installation has the "Auto-Read Receipt"
      setting turned on.  The SCCo-standard Outpost configuration specifies that
      this setting should be turned off.  You can find it on the Receipts tab of
      the Message Settings dialog in Outpost.
  SessionDate:
    actions: report
    response: |
      This message is being counted for {SESSIONNAME} on {SESSIONDATE}, but the
      subject line says it's intended for a net on {SUBJECTDATE}.  This may
      indicate that the message was sent to the wrong net.
  SubjectFormat:
    actions: report error
    responses:
      parse: |
        This message has an incorrect subject line format.  According to SCCo
        standards, the subject should look like
            AAA-111P_R_Practice A6AAA, Charlie, Nowhereville, 03/16/2019
            (msgnum) |            |    (name)   (city)        (net date)
              (handling order)  (call sign)
      plainform: |
        This message has an incorrect subject line format.  According to SCCo
        standards, the subject should look like
            AAA-111P_R_Practice A6AAA, Charlie, Nowhereville, 03/16/2019
            (msgnum) |            |    (name)   (city)        (net date)
              (handling order)  (call sign)
        Note that there is no form name between the handling order and the word
        "Practice" for plain text messages.  If this is in fact a form message,
        it is improperly encoded and was not recognized as a form.
      practice: |
        This message has an incorrect subject line format.  According to SCCo
        standards, the subject should look like
            AAA-111P_R_Practice A6AAA, Charlie, Nowhereville, 03/16/2019
            (msgnum) |            |    (name)   (city)        (net date)
              (handling order)  (call sign)
        Note that there is no underline after the word "Practice".
  SubjectHasSeverity:
    actions: report error
    response: |
      The Subject line of this message contains a both a Severity code and a
      Handling Order code ("_{SEVERITY}/{HANDLING}_").  This is an outdated
      Subject line style.  Current SCCo standards include only the Handling
      Order code on the Subject line ("_{HANDLING}_").
  ToBBSDown:
    actions: report dontcount
    response: |
      This message was sent to {TOCALLSIGN} at {TOBBS}, but {TOBBS} has a
      simulated outage for {SESSIONNAME} on {SESSIONDATE}.  Practice messages
      for this session must be sent to {TOCALLSIGN} at {SESSIONBBSES}.
  ToBBS:
    actions: report dontcount
